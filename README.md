# Friot

This repository is the resource space used for supporting 
the #13 submission to ICECCS 2019: 

"Friot: A Functional Reactive Language for IoT Programs with Dependent Type-and-Effect System"




What you can find here are:

(1) A Report: providing more type reasoning trees for more functions;

(2) More Friot examples for MicroBit and Raspberry Pi: providing more Friot IoT programs to demonstrate the usage of this domain-specific language;

(3) A compiler: compile Friot to JS code;

(4) Experiments for those compiled JS codes on Raspberry Pi B+.
